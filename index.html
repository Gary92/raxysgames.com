				<h2 class="post_title">MAJOR UPDATE FOR GEOMETRY JUNK OUT NOW ON GOOGLE PLAY STORE</h2>

				<p class="thumbnail"><img src="img/geometry_junk_update192.png" alt="Geometry Junk" width="399" height="192"></p>

				<p>Ladies and gentlemen, organic and inorganic beings, we're proud to announce that <b>the first major update for Geometry Junk is now available</b> on Google Play Store.</p>

				<p>The update introduces the <b>Rush Mode</b>, a new and more difficult challenge for veterans of Geometry Junk. Pieces of junk will fall down more frequently than before, but the new power-ups will help you going on as much as you can! Rush Mode is included in premium version of the game.</p>

				<p>Don't worry, basic users have not been forgotten! <b>Achievements are now available for everyone</b>, you can now challenge yourself trying to get most of them. In addition, ads load has been reduced so you can better focus on those falling pieces.</p>

				<p>Wait, that's not all. To celebrate the launch of this major update, <b>we decided to reduce the price of Geometry Junk premium version</b>. You can get it in-game (via in-app purchase), instead new users can download the game from our <a href="geometryjunk.html">products page</a>.</p>

				<p>We hope every user will enjoy the new Geometry Junk. Don't forget to give feedback, please contact us if you encounter any error or problem and we'll try to solve it. Your help is essential to improve our games.</p>
