				<h2 class="post_title">GEOMETRY JUNK 1.2 UPDATE OUT NOW ON GOOGLE PLAY STORE</h2>

				<p class="thumbnail"><img src="img/geometry_junk_update192.png" alt="Geometry Junk" width="399" height="192"></p>

				<p>Ok, the above image has not changed from the previous post, but believe us: the new <b>Geometry Junk 1.2 update</b> is a big step forward!</p>

				<p>With this update our main goal was to make the game more stable, however we added some cool features to make it more captivating too. First, the <b>gameplay</b> is now faster (both CLASSIC and RUSH modes) so you can now reach higher scores in shorter sessions. We consequently made some changes to balance the new gameplay.</p>

				<p>Second, <b>Google Play Games login need</b> has been revised (and removed in some cases). Login request at startup is now shown only the very first time you play the game, then it will be replaced by a "user not logged in" advice. In addition, you can now proceed with "Super" version in-app purchase even if you are not logged in with Play Games.</p>

				<p>We also introduced a <b>local system of achievements</b>, so users who don't want to login can still challenge themselves and try to obtain all the achievements. When a player finally decides to login, all the local achievements will be synchronized and unlocked on the Play Games platform too.</p>

				<p>Last but not least, <b>daily high scores</b> reached without an internet connection are now synchronized the first time you run the game with an active internet connection. Thanks to synchronization, you can play and reach high scores whenever you want and they will be added to online leaderboards later.</p>

				<p>We invite you to take a look at <a href="geometryjunk.html">Geometry Junk page</a> for further informations and download link. We also invite you to give feedback after playing and to contact us if you encounter any error or problem. Remember: we need your help to improve our games, support us!</p>
